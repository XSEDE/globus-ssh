# SSH with Globus Auth

SSH with Globus Auth delivers use of federated identities to the SSH
platform providing a uniform security infrastructure for institutions.
The solution supports both programmatic and interactive use, eliminating
the need for management of SSH keys and is a replacement for the
deprecated GSI SSH product.

SSH with Globus Auth is distributed as client and server packages, both
referred to as `globus-ssh`. The client is a Python package that manages
Globus Auth tokens on behalf of the user. The server package provides a
security module loadable into the SSH authentication process for
authentication via Globus Auth token introspect and account mapping.

Bugs reports and feature requests are open submission, and should be filed at
https://github.com/xsede/globus-ssh-client/issues.

The PyPi project can be found at: https://pypi.org/project/globus-ssh/.

The server-side components are located in [the server subdirectory](server/README.md).
The client-side components are located in [the client subdirectory](client/README.md).
