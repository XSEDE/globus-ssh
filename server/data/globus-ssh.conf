# This file configures the OAuth PAM module for use with SSH.

# In order to configure your SSH service for use with Globus Auth, you must
# first visit https://developers.globus.org/ to register this SSH service as
# a client to Globus Auth. Afterwards, record the client id and secret with
# client_id and client_secret, respectively.

# Set this key to the client id received when you registered this SSH service
# with Globus Auth.
client_id  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

# Set this key to the client secret received when you registered this SSH
# service with Globus Auth.
client_secret  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX


#
# ACCOUNT MAPPING OPTIONS
#
# When a user connects via oauth-ssh, the service will initially know the
# connected user as a Globus Auth identity. The following options allow you to
# specify how the SSH service should 'map' those identities to local accounts.
#
# NOTE: You may choose idp_suffix, map_file, or both. But you must choose at
# least one. A connecting user will be able to take advantage of all configured
# mapping options.

# (OPTIONAL) idp_suffix is used for account mapping. Set this to the domain 
# of the chosen IdP, as known by Globus Auth. When a user connects, the module
# will search for a linked identity for the user issued by this IdP. If a match
# is found, the username associated with the linked identity becomes an option
# for a local account mapping.
#idp_suffix globus.org

# (OPTIONAL) Specify a text file to be used to map linked identities to local
# accounts. See the example map file for details on its format.
map_file /etc/oauth-ssh/globus-acct-map

# Use this option multiple times to include additional map files.
#map_file path-to-mapfile2

#
# HIGH ASSURANCE (SESSION) OPTIONS
#
# The following two options (permitted_idps, authentication_timeout) allow
# the system administrator to impose stricter authentication requirements.
#
# See https://docs.globus.org/api/auth/sessions/ for more information.

# (OPTIONAL) Require that users have authenticated to one or more of the
# following identity providers within their current session. The value
# is a comma-separated list of identity providers. If left blank, the user
# may authenticate to any Globus-supported identity provider.
#
#permitted_idps globus.org, xsede.org

# (OPTIONAL) Require that the user has authenticated within the current session
# within the recent timeframe. The value of this option is minutes since
# authentication permitted for successful user login. When used in conjunction
# with permitted_idps, the user is required to have authenticated within
# this timeout with one of the permitted_idps. If permitted_idps is not 
# specified, the user is required to have authenticated to any Globus-supported
# identity provider within the given timeframe.
#
# Comment out or give a value of 0 to disable this feature.
#authentication_timeout 60
